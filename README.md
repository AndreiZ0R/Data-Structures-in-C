# Data-Structures-in-C
Hello, here I implemented a few of the commonly used data structures in C, with some of the main functionalities of the structures.
Each structure has .c file with an associated header, so make sure you get them.
This may not be final :P

NOTE: There are only a few tests of the structures, feel free to create and test your own.
